<p>I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight</p>
<p>I can't be the only—</p>
<br>
<p>Yeah, does anybody feel like me?</p>
<p>Show of hands, I don't need a lot, I just wanna find my peace</p>
<p>Yeah, why you throwin' rocks, oh, you wanna kill my dreams?</p>
<p>Okay, tell me everything I'm not</p>
<p>You think I didn't know those things?</p>
<p>Always been a little lost and I still might be</p>
<p>Life's hard, but it's okay (Okay)</p>
<p>Watchin' the comments feels like I'm at a court date</p>
<p>How could I complain</p>
<p>With a house like this and a car like that in the driveway?</p>
<p>Half of what I say</p>
<p>Kinda feels like a dream that I'm gonna wake from someday</p>
<p>Wishin' that I'd pray</p>
<p>A little more often and put more time into my faith</p>
<p>Travel in my brain, woo, might find damage and no grace</p>
<p>Things that I hold on to, but I won't say things that I won't let go</p>
<p>So I chain my soul to the heartbreak</p>
<p>Havin' a nice day, that's not a average in my case</p>
<p>Stones like cameras in my face; glamour, it's all fake</p>
<p>Love my job, but it might seem odd that I'm here 'cause I hate fame</p>
<p>Yeah, pay my debt to me, throwin' threats at me</p>
<p>They can't tell this connectin' me, it's affectin' me</p>
<p>Hide that well, they'll write checks to me, but don't check on me</p>
<p>By myself, always questioning what comes next for me</p>
<p>I can't be the only—</p>
<br>
<p>No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight</p>
<p>No, I can't be the only—</p>
<br>
<p>Yeah, if you made a list of people that you trusted</p>
<p>Would you put your name down?</p>
<p>Do you know who you are?</p>
<p>When you look at life and you talk about yours, do you feel proud?</p>
<p>Are you leaving a mark, or scared to make a bad impression?</p>
<p>So you just go hide in the dark</p>
<p>Livin' and playin' a part, knowin' regret'll come back tomorrow</p>
<p>That's what it does, ain't it? Don't know what we're chasin'</p>
<p>But we all do it, just a part of life, I guess we're all foolish</p>
<p>Running after what we think will make us happy 'til it falls through</p>
<p>And then we find out later it ain't what we wanted</p>
<p>So we give up on it, then we pile the garbage</p>
<p>And we watch it grow and find a drug and numb it</p>
<p>'Til we hit the point that we can barely function</p>
<p>Am I motivated? Is my music dated?</p>
<p>Would I be the same if I was medicated?</p>
<p>Even therapists say I need medication</p>
<p>I avoid it, though, because I'm scared to take it</p>
<p>Am I the only one that has a loaded gun</p>
<p>That's full of doubts and memories to overcome?</p>
<p>And I complain about 'em when they shoot at me</p>
<p>But I know truthfully I like to load 'em up and let 'em—</p>
<p>That's so sad to see, that's so sad to see, I need help</p>
<p>They talk passively, then come after me by myself</p>
<p>Lost that half of me, God, there has to be someone else</p>
<p>Don't feel bad for me, I just can't believe that I'm lonely</p>
<br>
<p>No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight</p>
<p>No, I can't be the only—</p>
<br>
<p>There's gotta be somebody out there</p>
<p>There's gotta be somebody somewhere</p>
<p>That needs company, and it's comforting to know, know</p>
<p>There's gotta be somebody out there</p>
<p>There's gotta be somebody somewhere</p>
<p>That needs company, and it's comforting to know</p>
<br>
<p>I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight</p>
<p>No, I (I) can't be the only— (Only)</p>
