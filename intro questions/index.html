        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        1. Hey! My name is Hadi, and I am a junior studying Communication Design and minoring in Human Computer Interaction.
    
        <p>2. I transferred into Com Des from Architecture. After graduation I would like to work somewhere in the UX/UI field. I enrolled in Interaction Foundations to expand my mind and have more tools in my tool belt.</p>

        <p>3. Currently, I have no experience in HTML/CSS/JS, but that's going to change this semester :) </p>
        
        <p>4. I hope to learn how to create interactive design projects that I can add to my portfolio.</p>

        <p>5. Something that I expect would be different between designing for screen and paper would be the use of code. I'm guessing that designing for the screen will be harder.</p>
        
        <p>6. A website that I think shows effective design is <a href=https://nomadgoods.com>this one.</a> The use of varying sizes of images is fantastic, the website has a modern and sleek design, and it follows a consistent color scheme of greyscale and browns.</p>

        <p>7. I think <a href=https://www.fcpeuro.com>this website</a> portrays effective communication. It's a website for buying car parts, and it's very easy to navigate and search for things for your specific vehicle. They place all the right info at the top of the page.</p>

        <p>8. One website that just works well is <a href=https://www.google.com/maps>Google Maps.</a> It does a great job of being simple yet effective to find your destination, while also not overloading the user with info.</p>
